## To-Do List Manager in C

### Tasks

- [X] Add a task
- [X] Remove a task
- [X] Display all tasks
- [ ] Save tasks to a file
- [ ] Load tasks from a file
- [X] Error handling
- [X] Dynamic memory allocation

### Dependencies
- gcc
- make

### How to run

1. run `$ make`
2. run `$ ./main`

### Requirements

- Create a console-based to-do list manager in C.
- Implement functionalities for adding, removing, and displaying tasks.
- Save and load tasks from a file for persistent storage.
- Ensure proper error handling for invalid input and file I/O operations.
- Use dynamic memory allocation for managing tasks.

### Restrictions

- Avoid using complex data structures like linked lists; use arrays to store tasks.
- Do not use external libraries for file I/O operations.
- Ensure a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.

### Submission Guidelines

- Submit the source code files along with a Makefile for compilation.
- Include a README file providing instructions on how to use the to-do list manager.
- Discuss any challenges faced during implementation and how they were overcome.
